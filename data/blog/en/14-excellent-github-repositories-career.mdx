The technology field is huge, and many can have difficulties when organizing their studies to enter the field, especially at the beginning. Although the field has many available resources, the fact that it's so comprehensive leaves us "lost" in the hunt for resources, help, ideas, among other things.

And this is completely normal! That's exactly why, on Github, there are several open repositories made by people who want to help in various sectors and addressing different topics, exactly to help boost your studies. Knowing the amount of useful repositories, I couldn't help but write about the 14 that I most enjoyed seeing on the platform and that can help you as they've already helped me.

Remember that Github is a platform that hosts source code through version control (Git). If you want to understand more about how Git and Github work, don't forget to check out my article [**here**](https://andradelucas.medium.com/git-e-github-entendendo-como-funciona-o-controle-de-vers%C3%A3o-4a85d363c615).

## 1 - Design Resources for developers

As the name suggests, the repository stores [**various free design-related resources**](https://github.com/iuricode/recursos-gratuitos), and front-end folks will find a world to explore in one address. From photos and icons to use in your project, to CSS libraries or frameworks like React and Vue, it's really a very large and useful repository for your project or simply for learning.

## 2 - Github Readme Status

Depending on the user, you'll want to customize your Github. After all, it's your portfolio, where your most important projects are stored. For this, Anurag Hazra created a kind of template to store your main activities on Github. For those who like to keep their profile more organized and beautiful, [**it's worth taking a look**](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats).

## 3 - Awesome Hacking Resources

Ideal for information security students, [**the repository contains various materials for studying the topic**](https://github.com/vitalysim/Awesome-Hacking-Resources), which is so comprehensive and involves many concepts. YouTube channels, malware analysis, and forums are some of the many topics that contain various cool references and external links.

## 4 ‚Äì App Ideas

One of the most creative and organized repositories I've ever seen. The [**App Ideas**](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas) is exactly what the name says... A repository loaded with ideas for developers to create their applications. But it has some differentials: Its readme separates ideas by knowledge levels. Calculators and Previewers for beginners, currency converters and chrome extensions for intermediates, even an Instagram clone for more advanced, among many others.

In addition, the repository has a kind of to-do list within each idea as a requirements list to do gradually. It's very worth checking out.

## 5 - Free Programming Books

The ebook foundation created [**this sensational repository**](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books) LOADED with free books for those who like to read about programming and technology. And for those who don't understand English or simply want to read in other languages, relax, it has various languages, and separated by various topics within technology. It's very worth diving deep!

## 6 - Public APIs

Who has never gone through a headache without ideas, and just seeing an API already wanted to implement something on top? [**This repository**](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) has several APIs to help you with that, separated by themes and showing whether they need authentication or not, among other things. I'm already going to use some APIs from there for some project, maybe...

## 7 - Javascript Testing: Best Practices

[**This repository**](https://github.com/goldbergyoni/javascript-testing-best-practices) contains various texts, written and translated in various languages (including Portuguese) about testing done in javascript, besides Node. Showing various best practices on the subject, the repository promises to make you spend a good reading time.

## 8 - The Art Of Command Line

For Linux lovers, [**this repository**](https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line) brings you up to date with the system's main resources, obviously, in the terminal, which is its main resource. With detailed reading, you can learn a lot about Linux on the command line just with this repository. I've already favorited it to read more deeply, as it's really a lot of content. Oh, and it's translated into Portuguese :)

## 9 - Developer Roadmap

What a sensational repository, seriously... One of the most famous on Github. Updated every year, the [**developer roadmap**](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap) helps you trace a learning path until becoming a Front-End, Back-End or DevOps developer.

There are really many subjects covered for each area, from optional to mandatory, which you should know to continue. Oh, and even before choosing your area, make sure you know the topics in the left corner of the image.

## 10 ‚Äì Clean Code

The book is very well known, and you've probably heard of it. Clean Code helps you create a concept of clean, readable and easily maintainable code. But there are several repositories on Github with information about the book adapted for various languages and technologies. So, here's a small list:

- [**Clean Code - Javascript**](https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript)

These repositories can help you make your code more beautiful, which is a differential in a decent system or for an employer. Imagine you at the front line of a selection process having to analyze various codes full of workarounds? üòê

## 11 - Coding Interview University

Speaking of selection processes... The [**Coding Interview University**](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university) is a repository that gathers various themes to prepare you for processes at large corporations as a software engineer, like Google, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft.

The repository really brings you up to date with everything and, delving into all subjects with dedication (understand, this demands **TIME**) you'll surely arrive at a selection process very well prepared.

## 12 - Job Opportunities

For those who are looking for their first job, these repositories can really contribute a lot. Aimed at React, Flutter, Front and Back-End in general, among many others, job repositories are well present on Github. Here's a small list of some:
